# Simle-Movie-Recommendation-System
A simple movie recommendation system written in Python which uses concepts of tf-idf vectorization and cosine similarity.

My teammate and I developed this movie recommendation system in our 4th semester. We used kaggle as reference for this project(link below).
We have also written a handbook detailing every step taken whilst developing the project.
